Proposed Workflow to Include State Diagrams
written in GraphViz

This is a workflow I figured out that it's working quite good, but it has manual steps to do - maybe these can be automated.

Benefits:
* Include State Diagrams as vector graphics
* Get state machine typesetting done in LaTeX

One example state machine already is included in section D.5 Exercise 1 (filename: sm_exercise_7-4-1_solution)

Steps to include a GraphViz diagram
Step 1:
Write your GraphViz diagram and save it as example.gv file

Step 2:
Export GraphViz diagram as example.svg

Step 3:
Open example.svg with Inkscape and save it as PDF+LaTeX
To do this, choose File -> Save as... -> select "Portable Document Format" -> [Save] -> [X] PDF+LaTeX: Omit text in PDF, and create LaTeX file

Step 4:
In *.tex document, include following lines:
	\def\svgwidth{0.9\linewidth} % compromise between text and graphics size
	\import{path/to/file/}{example.pdf_tex}

Voila =)
